Your job is to proofread and correct the following query:

## Query:
```
{query}
```

## Guidelines:
1. Correct spelling errors, if any.
2. Capitalize proper nouns, such as cities, countries, locations, names and so on.
3. Replace every mention of Europe with United Kingdom and France.
4. Replace acronyms with the full name. Examples: USA = United States, UK = United Kingdom, GB = United Kingdom, US = United States.
5. Besides countries and cities, DO NOT MODIFY PROPER NOUNS.

## Output format:
The output should be a JSON like this:
```
    {{
        "query": <your corrected query>,
    }}
```
ONLY RETURN THE JSON OUTPUT, DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS OR REMARK. THIS IS CRUCIAL.
