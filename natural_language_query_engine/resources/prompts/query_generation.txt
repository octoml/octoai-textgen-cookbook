Given these Couchbase collections,

## Collections
```
{collections}
```

And the corresponding JSON schemas:

## Schemas
```
{schemas}
```

Your task is to produce a syntactically correct SQL++ that can be used in Couchbase to answer the following query:

## Query:
```
{query}
```

## Guidelines:
1. Make sure your query is a syntactically correct SQL++ query that can run in Couchbase without any errors.
2. Make sure to qualify each field and subfield with the correct collection name.
3. The collections name should be used only ONCE for qualification.
   For example, this is CORRECT:
   ###
    SELECT DISTINCT landmark.name, landmark.geo.lat, landmark.geo.lon
    FROM `landmark`
    WHERE landmark.country IN ['Albania', 'Andorra']
    ORDER BY .landmark.name
    LIMIT 3;
   ####


   This is WRONG:
   ###
    SELECT DISTINCT landmark.landmark.name, landmark.landmark.geo.lat, landmark.landmark.geo.lon
    FROM `landmark`
    WHERE landmark.landmark.country IN ['Albania', 'Andorra']
    ORDER BY landmark.landmark.name
    LIMIT 3;
   ###
 5. Make sure to proofread the input query, and correct any spelling errors.
 6. Replace every mention of Europe with United Kingdom and France.
 7. Replace acronyms with the full name. Examples: USA = United States, UK = United Kingdom, GB = United Kingdom, US = United States.

ONLY RETURN THE SQL++ QUERY, DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
