# DocTalk Demo ü¶ô

A Next.js-based demo showcasing Llama2 using various docs sources. It utilizes the [OctoAI Design System](https://github.com/octoml/design-system).

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

-   Next.js
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind
-   Zustand

## Consuming OctoML Design System üçΩÔ∏è

Your host system/repository have a few security prerequisites for consumption of the OctoML Design System.

First, you need to export a GitHub Personal Access token with `read:packages` rights from your system under the variable name `NPM_TOKEN`. To do this:

-   Go to [Github Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
-   Create a **classic** access token
-   Set the permissions to `read:packages`
-   Save a copy.

Source this as `NPM_TOKEN` from your shell.

Second, you need to add an `.npmrc` file to the root of your project with the following information:

```
@octoml:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

With these in place, you should now be able to install all of the packages (including the Design System) using the yarn command.

## Run Locally üíª

```shell
git clone https://github.com/octoml/octoai-textgen-cookbook.git
```

Go to the frontend locally

```bash
cd doctalk/nextjs
