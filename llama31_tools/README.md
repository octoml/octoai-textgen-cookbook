# Using OctoAI with LlamaIndex
Meta's latest Llama3.1 models offer unique function calling capabilities. In particular they offer built-in tool calling capabilities for the following 3 external tools:
* Brave Search: internet search
* Code Interpreter: Python code interpreter
* Wolfram Alpha: mathematical and scientific knowledge tool


## What you will build
You will learn how to make use of these built in capabilities to address some of the notorious weaknesses of LLMs:
* Limited ability to reason about complex mathematical notions
* Limited ability to answer questions about current events (or data that wasn't included in the model's training set)

## What you will use
You'll learn to invoke Llama3.1 models hosted on OctoAI, and make use of the model's built in tool calling capabilities via a standardized OpenAI-compatible chat completions API.


## Instructions
Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed in your environment before launching the notebook in the `llama31_tools` directory.

The rest of the instructions are described in the notebook itself.
